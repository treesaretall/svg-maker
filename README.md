# Logo Generator App

This is a command-line application that generates a logo based on user input. The logo consists of a shape and text. The user can choose the characters, text color, shape type, and shape color for their logo.

## Installation

The application will prompt you with a series of questions to customize your logo:

1. **What characters would you like on your logo?** Enter the characters you want to appear on your logo. The maximum length allowed is 3.

2. **What color would you like your text to be?** Enter the color for the text of your logo. You can use either a color keyword or a hexadecimal value. The input will be validated to ensure it is a valid color.

3. **What shape would you like your logo to be?** Choose the shape for your logo from the provided list of options: Square, Triangle, or Circle.
